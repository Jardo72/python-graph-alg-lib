# Library of Graph Algorithms for Python

## Introduction
Library of Graph Algorithms for Python is a simple Python library providing implementations of various graph algorithms. It is more or less an educational/experimental project serving as sandbox for improvement of my Python skills. The following algorithms are provided:
- Topological Sort
- Dijsktra Algorithm (Shortest Path)


## Runtime Environment, Source Code Organization etc.

### Python Version and Dependencies
TODO
- Python 3.8
- library code depends only on the Python Standard Library; it does not depend on any other module
- unit tests depend on PyTest 5.4.3
- optionally PyTest Coverage 2.10.0 if you want to measre the code coverage

### Library Code
The library code is divided to four modules:
- `graphlib.grap` module provides two graph implementation (adjacency matrix, adjacency set), plus
an abstract base class prescribing the public API of any graph implementation.
- `graphlib.algorithms`
- `graphlib.util` module provides functionalities that support the implementation of the algorithms, for instance a priority queue.
- `graphlib.dump` module provides dump-functions that can pretty-print various structures like graph, result of shortest path search, minimum spanning tree etc. These functions can write their output to a file, to stdout, or to an instance of io.StringIO.


### Test Code


## Creation of Distribution Package
In order to build the distribution package, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

The command above creates both source archive (in .tar.gz format) and distribution in wheel format.


## Execution of Unit Tests
In order to execute the unit tests, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
python -m pytest -v tests
```

The following command triggers the execution of the unit tests, and it also generate code coverage report in HTML format.
```
python -m pytest --cov=graphlib --cov-branch --cov-report html tests
```
